## How To Run Locally

Just ***follow*** this steps:

2. Clone the project (or download ZIP and unzip the archive).
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/UndreamableDreamer/ProjectsBase.git
```
3. Go to the project directory.
```bash
cd ProjectsBase
```
4. **IMPORTANT** Install dependencies.
*If you don't know what are you doing, this step will solve most of the problems.*
```bash
npm install
```
5. Start the project. In package.json you can find multiple options to start. 
*If you don't know, what are you doing, just execute the code below.*
```bash
npm run start
``` 

## FAQ

#### Can I rename the project folder?

Yes, you absolutelly can. 

#### Can I rename the folders or files inside?

Only, ***ONLY*** if you know what are you doing. 

#### Can I change dependencies or modify any files inside?

For short - check the answer for the question before. For long - yes, you can, but I'm not responsible for any issues you'll get. But you can safely add components and change the entry point - App.tsx file. 

#### - How to remove your commits?

Just download ZIP instead of cloning.
